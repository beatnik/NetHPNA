=head1 NAME

Net::HP::NA::User - Access Cisco HP Network Automation functionality through SOAP API - User fields

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Net::HP::NA;
	use Net::HP::NA::User;
  
	my $na = Net::HP::NA->new(hostname => '10.0.0.1', username => 'admin', password => 'testPassword');
	my $user = Net::HP::NA::User->new("name"=>"soloh","description"=>"Han Solo","identityGroupName"=>"All Groups:MilleniumCrew","password"=>"Leia");

	my %users = $na->users;
	# Retrieve all users from HP Network Automation
	# Returns hash with username / Net::HP::NA::User pairs
	
	print $na->users->{"HP Network Automationadmin"}->toXML;
	# Dump in XML format (used by HP Network Automation for API calls)
	
	my $user = $na->users("name","HP Network Automationadmin");
	# Faster call to request specific user information by name

	my $user = $na->users("id","150");
	# Faster call to request specific user information by ID (assigned by HP Network Automation, present in Net::HP::NA::User)

	$user->id(0); # Required for new user!
	my $id = $na->create($user);
	# Create new user based on Net::HP::NA::User instance
	# Return value is ID generated by HP Network Automation
	print "Record ID is $id" if $id;
	print $Net::HP::NA::ERROR unless $id;
	# $Net::HP::NA::ERROR contains details about failure

	my $id = $na->update($user);
	# Update existing user based on Net::HP::NA::User instance
	# Return value is ID generated by HP Network Automation
	print "Record ID is $id" if $id;
	print $Net::HP::NA::ERROR unless $id;
	# $Net::HP::NA::ERROR contains details about failure

	$na->delete($user);
	# Delete existing user based on Net::HP::NA::User instance
